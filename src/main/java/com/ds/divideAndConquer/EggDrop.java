 * You are given n identical eggs and you have access to a k-floored building from 1 to k.
 *
 * There exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= k such that any egg dropped from a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped from or below floor f will not break. There are a few rules given below:
 *
 * An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
 * A broken egg must be discarded.
 * The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
 * If the egg doesnâ€™t break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.
 * If the egg breaks on a certain floor, it will break on any floor above.
